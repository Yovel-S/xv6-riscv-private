TASK 4
-------------------
1. The scheduler is implemented in proc.c (line 447)
2. In will choose the next runnable process in a round robin manner.
3. First of allm memory is allocated to the process by looking in the process table for an unused proc.
If found, the system initializes state required to run in the kernel. Then user memory is copied from parent.
Each CPU calls scheduler after setting itself up. In addition, the scheduling takes place each time a process calls one the system calls: [sleep, yield, exit], which in turn call sched. 
4. When a process calls one the system calls for instance sleep, yield, or exit,  the method sched is called to call the scheduler to call tje next process to execute.




Lasim lev:
-What happens when a process calls a system call, for instance
sleep()?
-if runtime, sleeptime.. can be ints
